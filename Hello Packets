Discover OSPF Neighbors

Sent periodically to 224.0.0.5
	Typically every 10 ~ seconds

Some networks don't support multicast
	Router's peer IP must be manually configured
	Hello packets sent unicast (typically every 30~ seconds)

Content of Hello determines if Routers will become Neighbors

**Inside A Hello Packet**

1. **Router ID** - identity of each router
	32 bit - not an IP address
	
2. **Hello Interval** - Frequency of periodic hello's
3. **Dead Interval** - Duration to remember Neighbor
	Typically 4x Hello Interval
	
4. **Neighbors** - Neighbor Router ID(s) seen on link
	validates two-way reachability
	
5.  **Area ID** - OSPF Area interface belongs to

6. **Authentication Data** - Password restricted peering

7.  **Network Mask** - Subnet Mask for link

8. [[Area types]] - Normal, Stub, NSSA

9. DR - Designated Router - IP address of DR

10. BDR - Backup Designated Router - IP address of BDR

11. Priority - 0-255  - default: 1 - Influences DR/BDR election - higher is preferred

On multi-access links a DR is elected
	Central point for all updates on Link
	 Reduces redundant updates

**MUST Match for Adjacency**
	Hello Interval
	 Dead Interval
	 Area ID
	 Authentication Data
	 Network Mask
	 Area Type
